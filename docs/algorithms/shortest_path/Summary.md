## Shortest Path Summary

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Nearly linear-time when weights are non-negative
- Generalization encompasses DFS, BFS, and Prim.

### Acyclic Edge-weighted Digraph

- Aris in applications
- Faster than Djikstra's algorithm
- Negative weights are no problem

### Negative Weights and Negative Cycles

- Arise in applications
- If no negative-cycles, can find shortest path via Bellman-Ford
- if negative-cycles, can find one via Bellman-Ford

Shortest paths is a broadly useful problem-solving model
